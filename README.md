# HackerNewsCloneApp
Clone App of HackerNews - for the Demo purpose of WWStay Programming Test

The Hacker News App is demonstrated here using the AngularJS (Version 1) framework. Only additional module used apart from standard AngularJS is Angular Sanitize. 

Angular Sanitize is used to print the 'comments' (that API returns) which has HTML content.

See the working demo here.

Notes:
* There are Hacker News API which returns, latest 500 Best Stories, Top Stories and New Stories. I have used those APIs to demonstrate its use.
* Each Story the API returns can have multiple comments and nested comments associated with it. I have not counted the nested comments for demo purpose. It can be easily integrated anyways.
